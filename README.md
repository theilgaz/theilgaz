<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Abdullah</h1>
<h4 align="center">Muslim • Writing and deleting code • RESTafarian • MVP</h4>

Creating new products, crafting software for humans, and uncovering novel technologies and innovations fuel my inner drive. Accomplishing tasks is not just a goal; it's my motivation.

My journey includes valuable experiences in developing database applications, designing templates, and establishing architectures within the IT sector. Over the years, my involvement in various facets of the industry, such as system analysis, user interface design, backend development, software architecture, and team leadership, has enriched my skill set.

Currently, I'm immersing myself in uncharted territories within the realm of informatics, pushing boundaries, and acquainting myself with both the known and unknown limitations. My primary focus lies on mastering serverless technologies, a domain I'm keenly exploring.

One of my greatest passions revolves around crafting .NET solutions within the AWS environment, and I'm enthusiastic about sharing my insights with the broader community. Whether individuals seek solutions, embark on their AWS and .NET journey, or simply crave knowledge, I contribute by crafting articles, blogs, and assembling repositories of sample code.
